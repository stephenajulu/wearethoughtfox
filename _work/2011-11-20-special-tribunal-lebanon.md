The [Special Tribunal for Lebanon](http://www.stl-tsl.org/) is an international tribunal established by the [United Nations](http://www.un.org/) to hold trials for the people accused of carrying out the attack of 14 February 2005 which killed 23 people, including the former prime minister of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri, and injured many others. We Are Thought Fox led the website relaunch and was in charge of all aspects of the project from experience design to creating and managing a team. Visual design by [ilprogetto design studio](http://ilprogetto.gr) and Joomla templates by [Angie Radtke](http://www.der-auftritt.de/).
