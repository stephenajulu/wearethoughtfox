excerpt: Visualising data from 2007-2016 on a timeline and map using D3
---

Amnesty International publish figures on death penalties and executions around the world every year. In 2015, I began a project to visualise this data on a map and a timeline using D3. I worked with the internal design and content teams along with another developer at We Are Thought Fox to create a responsive application. Users can play through the timeline or search for a country or both. Languages are handled via a dictionary file to avoid duplication of data and everything is hosted and edited via Github. The application is embedded using a responsive iFrame.
