excerpt: Concept, design and development of a responsive website
---

The world's greatest vocational skills competition happens in a different city every two years with Abu Dhabi hosting the event in October 2017. In 2016, [We Are Thought Fox](http://wearethoughtfox.com) began a complete design and development project for the event.

I led the discovery phase - interviewing dozens of users and stakeholders around the world and developing and proiritising user needs. Working with our designer and the WorldSkills internal development team, we designed and developed an alpha version which we used to test the IA and various design concepts on users.

We went on to design and develop a responsive site in English and Arabic which launched on 15 July to coincide with World Youth Skills Day. You can read more about the process on the [development blog](http://worldskills.github.io/worldskillsabudhabi2017.com/blog)
