![Designs for iPad for Maclean’s](/images/blog-una-ipad.jpg)

Great design is central to We Are Thought Fox and our process respects the time required to achieve it. Each of us started off working in &#8216;traditional&#8217; media and in many ways that helped teach us the fundamentals in a way that perhaps learning digitally wouldn&#8217;t have.

My design life started about 8 years ago when I graduated from Toronto’s weirdest landmark—<a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ls5uxqe9HO1r2a51zo1_1280.jpg" target="_blank">Ontario College of Art & Design</a>. Since then I’ve had the chance to design, art direct and illustrate for some of Canada’s most exciting publications and collaborate with some inspiring people.

Here are a few of the wild and wonderful projects I’ve been lucky enough to participate in:

## Maclean’s: Canada’s weekly news magazine
I spent many late nights designing and making digital collages in a fast-paced news environment. After paying my dues, I was rewarded with digging through the magazine’s 100+ year history in order to inspire a magazine re-design and launch their revitalized online presence.

## Canadian Business: the country’s oldest business publication
I contributed to a complete rebrand of the magazine with the intent to make it vibrant, contemporary and not-just-for-old-white-guys anymore! One particularly funny photo shoot had us corralling dogs in glasses & ties around a boardroom table.

## Rogers iPad initiative: breaking new ground
As a design lead on a small team I worked on the strategy for Rogers communications iPad initiative. At the time we were pioneers in the land of tablet magazines so the challenges and rewards were equally great.

## Toronto Life, Special Issues
I worked on the launch of this vibrant city magazine’s extended family of publications: Stylebook, Cookbook, Real Estate, City Home, Weddings… This a was a labour of love that almost turned me into a snob, since I was constantly after the best new it-model/taco/cafe. Hectic yet rewarding, photo shoots had me running after an actress through a greenhouse, constructing a wedding cake out of cheese and riding a rickety bike up and down a busy street while a photographer snapped photos for a cover.

## Select Illustrations
A range of digital and hand-made collages for Maclean’s, Coach House books, Report on Business and Sex, etc., on topics from literary wars to sex ed.

## What’s next?
I’m currently inventing a brand new travel publication for an airport, but I can’t disclose the details. It’s a total dream project for me, since I’ve been enamoured with travel ever since I was a child. My parents even used to take me to the airport just to watch the planes take off.
