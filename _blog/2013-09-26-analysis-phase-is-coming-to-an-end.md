Over the last few weeks, we&rsquo;ve been examining who uses the ICC website, how they use it and what they need from a new ICC website. We&rsquo;ve used three main techniques:

1. **Data from web analytics** &#8211; Helps to understand users, uncover usage patterns, see most popular content and use search logs to see what people are looking for.
2. **Web survey** &#8211; Over 400 people answered the website survey in the last few weeks.
3. **Telephone interviews** &#8211; We have conducted interviews with users from the different audiences from around the world including the general public, journalists, NGOs, academics, lawyers and diplomats. 

We&rsquo;ve also talked to **representatives of the ICC organs and other stakeholders** about what they need from the website. 

All this work (which will be available here in the coming weeks) will guide and shape the next phase.

We&rsquo;ll be working in &ldquo;sprints&rdquo; building &ldquo; potentially shippable increments&rdquo; of the website. That means we start with the most important user needs and we design, build and test something to meet those needs, then we move on to the next sprint and repeat the process for another set of user needs. It&rsquo;s an exciting and effective way to work on the digital products and we hope it will work well at the ICC.
