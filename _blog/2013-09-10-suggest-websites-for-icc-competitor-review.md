It probably sounds a bit odd when used in the context of the ICC, but a &ldquo;competitor review&rdquo; is a process of examining other websites to see what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work.

We&rsquo;ll be looking at lots of other websites in the field of international justice and a few beyond. Suggestions have come from the website survey, interviews and conversations. 

If you have any examples from the field of international justice of people doing good things online, please add a comment below. 

Thanks!
