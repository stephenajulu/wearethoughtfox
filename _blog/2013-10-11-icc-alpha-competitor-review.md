We’ve looked at lots of other websites in the field of international justice and a few beyond to find interesting and exciting stuff. Suggestions have come from the website survey, interviews, conversations and a blog post.

Here are some of the things we’ve found. These ideas and approaches will inform the design stage of the ICC Alpha.  You can [download a pdf version (5.6MB) from Scribd if you prefer.](http://www.scribd.com/doc/175329365/ICC-Competitor-Review)

## IA / Top Navigation
![Top navigation of judicial websites](/images/blog-icc-comp1.jpg)

Lots of similar judicial sites follow the same IA format. Instead consider splitting the user journey more starkly with structured browse &#8211; situations/cases and the court &#8211; and having more flexible navigation. eg breadcrumb for situations/cases and a big footer. Use relatedness / relationships (tagging and metadata).

## Big footers
![Big footers examples](/images/blog-icc-comp2.jpg)

Good for reference. Informative. Useful. Almost like a sitemap at the bottom of every page.

## Timelines
![Timeline examples](/images/blog-icc-comp3.jpg)

An important tool to provide clarity, context and depth for the complex cases the ICC deals with, eg telling the story of the case.

## Imagery / Video
![Imagery examples](/images/blog-icc-comp4.jpg)

Not just walls of text. Telling a human story. Educate and inspire. Show what’s happening inside the ICC and beyond. Look further than the default option (robed judges in court).

## Presenting lots of text / pdfs
![Examples of how websites present lots of text](/images/blog-icc-comp5.jpg)

HTML needs to be the default publishing format with the exception of court filings. Effective use of typography. Plenty of white space. Readability on all devices is paramount. Clear indication of download, format, filesize before user clicks.

## Search, filter, sort
![Search examples](/images/blog-icc-comp6.jpg)

Search tools &#8211; see latest filings, filter by case, topic, keyword, etc &#8211; are very important.

## Email sign up / email alerts
![Email alert examples](/images/blog-icc-comp7.jpg)

Open up press list to anyone to sign up. Allow users to tailor subscription to specific areas, situations, cases. Offer alerts for new filings. These tools can be used in other sections, eg ASP.

## Maps
![Map examples](/images/blog-icc-comp8.jpg)

Good to represent the scope of the court’s work and its backing (ASP), but lots of difficulties around nuance and politics.

## Educational resources
![Classroom resource examples](/images/blog-icc-comp9.jpg)

Classroom resources and content for young people are important but difficult to do well. We need more information on audience and aims.

## Feedback / transparency
![Feedback examples](/images/blog-icc-comp10.jpg)

Including report an error, ask a question, see an article’s history, ask for feedback. Helps to establish trust, signal openness and find out about things you might be unaware of.

## Use of data / visualisations
![Feedback examples](/images/blog-icc-comp11.jpg)

To convey what the ICC has achieved judicially, politically and on the ground, eg trial chamber dealt with x decisions, x applications, x requests to give impression of complexity of the case.

Thanks! If you have any questions about this approach or the project in general, please feel free to leave a comment or contact Public Information and Documentation Section.
