After talking to lots of users and stakeholders, we&rsquo;ve set down the main aims of the new digital project. These broad ambitions will act as beacons to keep the digital project heading in the right direction and to check if the things we are working on are achieving what we set out to achieve.

It&rsquo;s important that everyone in the ICC gets behind these aims, so if you have anything to say, please leave a comment below or contact the Public Information and Documentation Section. Thanks!

The digital project aims to serve existing users better as well as to attract and engage a wider audience about the importance of the ICC and the effects of its work.

1. **Quicker, easier, clearer** — Users from all groups must be able to find what they need easily and quickly. All communications must be clear and concise, crafted in a way which most people can understand. The ICC is the authoritative voice about the ICC.

2. **More vibrant, more human, more engaging** — The ICC is an independent and impartial judicial institution, but its website must be more than a filing cabinet for legal decisions. The ICC website needs to provide context and explain the ICC work. Why does the ICC matter? Who has it helped and how has it affected their lives? Engage the user, listen to them and use each interaction as an opportunity to garner support for the ICC’s mission.

3. **More efficient, more effective** — Do as much as possible with as little as possible. Focus on the irreducible core: ICC does what only ICC can do. Every endeavour must answer a user need and have at least one measure of success, which will be monitored and reviewed over time.

4. **Accessible by everyone, everywhere** — Users must be able to access the website on “four screens” &#8211; laptop/PC, tablet, mobile and IPTV. It must cater for users with limited internet bandwidth and must work for people with disabilities, non-native En/Fr speakers. It must be built to withstand the rapid pace of technological change (ie, be based on web standards).
