Hierarchy - broad to narrow tree relationship



Database - similar things - get to know the things in different ways. Pieces are the same and there's lots of different ways to get to them - metadata / attributes. 



Hypertext - pieces related by relationships in content 



Linear - not on the web much. book, walking 



Catalogue = database sitting on top of hierarchy 



Hub and spoke - search results
